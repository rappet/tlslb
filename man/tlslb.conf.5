\f[B]tlslb.conf\f[R] \[em] TCP/TLS loadbalancer configuration file
.SH DESCRIPTION
The current behaviour of the loadbalancer can currently only be defined
by the configuration file.
.SH GLOBAL CONFIGURATION
Currently, this is empty.
.SH FRONTEND CONFIGURATION
Multiple frontends can be defined in the configuration file.
But in the current version, this is only limited to one frontend called
\[lq]https\[rq].
.TP
\f[CR]listen\-address\f[R]
Defines on which port/address the deamon should listen for a specific
frontend
.SS Example
.IP
.EX
[frontends.https]
listen\-address = \[dq][::]:8443\[dq]
type = \[dq]tls\[dq]
.EE
.SH BACKEND CONFIGURATION
.TP
\f[CR]addresses\f[R]
List of addresses to connect to
.RS
.PP
Either a socket address like \f[I]192.0.2.0:8443\f[R] or
\f[I][2001:db8::1]:8443\f[R] or an address like
\f[I]backend.tld:8443\f[R] that will result in a DNS lookup.
The set of all addresses/DNS responses will be used.
If one address appears multiple times during the lookup, it will only be
used once.
.RE
.TP
\f[CR]preconnect_count\f[R]
Count of connections that will be held idle in the pool as preparation
for new connections
.RS
.PP
The default value is 0, which means, that for each connecting client a
new connection to the backend will be made.
If the value is greater than 0, connections will be made in advance and
used for future connections on the frontend, which can result in faster
round trip times.
